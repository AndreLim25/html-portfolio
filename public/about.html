<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hello, I'm Andre, a computer science student at Universitas Sumatera Utara. I discovered my passion for technology during my time at Sutomo 1 Senior High School, where I was first introduced to the world of programming. Since then, I've
  been honing my skills in various programming languages and technologies, and I'm particularly interested in web development and software engineering. My academic journey has been a mix of challenging projects and exciting discoveries, all
  of which have deepened my love for coding.

  Outside of academics, I enjoy spending my free time playing games and staying active through badminton. These hobbies allow me to unwind and maintain a balance between work and play. Gaming fuels my creativity and problem-solving skills,
  while badminton keeps me physically fit and energized. Both activities have become integral parts of my life, providing me with the perfect mix of mental and physical stimulation.
